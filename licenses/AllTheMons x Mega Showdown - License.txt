Under no circumstances may any individual or entity, other than the author (see 3. Revenue Distribution & Author Compliance), monetize modified or unmodified copies of the Software. This includes but is not limited to redistributing modified copies of the Software publicly under a name that does not include the term “AllTheMons”, or incorporating it into Minecraft servers that feature donation or store pages as previously outlined.

Redistribution of the modified version is not permitted under this license until all the above conditions are fully met.
